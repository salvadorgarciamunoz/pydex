# pydex — Python Design of Experiments

An open-source Python package for optimal experiment design, essential to
a modeller's toolbelt. If you develop a model of any kind, you will relate
to the challenges of estimating its parameters. This tool helps design
maximally informative experiments for collecting data to calibrate your
model.

## Fork Notice

This is a fork of [pydex](https://github.com/KennedyPutraKusumo/pydex)
by Kennedy Putra Kusumo et al., originally described in:

> Kusumo, K.P., Kuriyan, K., Vaidyanathan, R., Shadbahr, T., Khan, F.I.,
> Harun, N., Sin, G. & Braatz, R.D. (2022). Explicit-Constraint-Based
> Optimal Experiment Design for Differential Equation Models.
> *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, 107940.

### Changes in this fork

- **V-optimal MBDoE**: two-stage workflow targeting prediction accuracy
  at a user-specified operating condition (`find_optimal_operating_point()`
  \+ `design_v_optimal()`)
- **Process optimisation**: constrained nonlinear optimisation via Pyomo
  to find the optimal operating point (Stage 1) before designing experiments
- **Pyomo-centric solver**: cvxpy removed; the pydex OED problem is now
  formulated and solved entirely via Pyomo, giving access to any solver
  callable through Pyomo (`solver="ipopt"`, `solver="gams"`, etc.) using
  `design_experiment(solver=..., solver_options={...})`
- **Parallel IFT sensitivity evaluation**: when a `pyomo_model_fn` is
  provided, sensitivities are computed via the Implicit Function Theorem
  (IFT) using the Pyomo NLP Jacobian; parallelised over candidates (local
  designs) or scenarios (pseudo-Bayesian designs) via `joblib` loky workers
- **Pyomo.DAE support**: full DAE models can serve as both the simulator
  and the IFT sensitivity source; signature-2 multi-output models
  supported
- **regularize_fim fix**: `regularize_fim=True` now correctly adds ε·I
  to the symbolic FIM expression in the Pyomo solve (previously the flag
  was stored but had no computational effect on the native solve path)
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 32 end-to-end tests covering all design
  criteria, both sensitivity paths (FD and IFT), parallel correctness,
  prior FIM, save/load, visualisation, and more
- **Improved documentation**: Sphinx/NumPy-compliant docstrings throughout
  `designer.py`

### Solvers

The pydex OED problem is formulated entirely in Pyomo, so solver
requirements depend on the type of problem being solved:

**Continuous designs** (standard D/A/E/V-optimal, pseudo-Bayesian, CVaR)
require a nonlinear programming (NLP) solver accessible through Pyomo.
IPOPT is recommended:

```bash
pip install cyipopt
```

> **Note:** `cyipopt` provides a Python interface to IPOPT. For best
> performance, configure IPOPT with HSL linear solvers (`MA27`, `MA57`)
> — see `docs/ipopt_setup_guide.docx` for installation instructions.
> The open-source solver `MUMPS` is available as a fallback.

Any other NLP solver supported by Pyomo (e.g. `glpk`, `cplex`) can also
be used by passing `solver=<solver_name>` to `design_experiment()`.

**Sparsity-enforcing MINLP designs** (`min_effort > 0`) require a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver. BARON via GAMS is
recommended:

```python
designer.design_experiment(
    criterion  = designer.d_opt_criterion,
    solver     = "gams",
    min_effort = 0.05,
)
```

---

## API Overview

### Basic D-optimal design

```python
from pydex.core.designer import Designer
import numpy as np

designer = Designer()
designer.simulate               = my_simulate_fn   # callable(tic, mp) -> array
designer.model_parameters       = np.array([...])
designer.ti_controls_candidates = candidate_grid

designer.initialize(verbose=1)
designer.eval_sensitivities()

designer.design_experiment(
    criterion      = designer.d_opt_criterion,
    solver         = "ipopt",
    solver_options = {"linear_solver": "ma57", "tol": 1e-8},
)
designer.print_optimal_candidates()
designer.apportion(n_exp=10)
```

### Pyomo.DAE model with automatic IFT and parallelisation

When `pyomo_model_fn` is provided, `use_pyomo_ift` and `n_jobs` are
auto-set at `initialize()` — no manual configuration needed:

```python
designer.simulate         = my_simulate_fn      # for predictions
designer.pyomo_model_fn   = my_build_model_fn   # for IFT Jacobian
designer.model_parameters = np.array([...])
designer.initialize(verbose=1)
# use_pyomo_ift=True and n_jobs=-1 set automatically

designer.design_experiment(
    criterion            = designer.d_opt_criterion,
    solver               = "ipopt",
    solver_options       = {"linear_solver": "ma57"},
    pseudo_bayesian_type = 0,   # for pseudo-Bayesian designs
)
```

### Pseudo-Bayesian design

```python
scenarios = np.column_stack([
    np.random.uniform(lb, ub, N),  # one column per uncertain parameter
    ...
])
designer.model_parameters = scenarios   # shape (N_scenarios, n_mp)

designer.design_experiment(
    criterion            = designer.d_opt_criterion,
    solver               = "ipopt",
    solver_options       = {"linear_solver": "ma57"},
    pseudo_bayesian_type = 0,   # 0 = average FIM; 1 = average criterion
)
```

---

## V-optimal MBDoE

V-optimal design minimises model prediction variance at a specific
operating condition `dw` (e.g. the economically optimal process point),
rather than minimising global parameter uncertainty as D/A-optimal designs
do. It follows a two-stage workflow:

**Stage 1 — Process optimisation:** find `dw` by solving a constrained
nonlinear programme over the operating space via Pyomo.

**Stage 2 — V-optimal MBDoE:** design experiments that minimise
`J_V = trace(W FIM⁻¹ Wᵀ)` where `W` is the scaled sensitivity matrix
evaluated at `dw`.

```python
# Stage 1
designer.process_objective   = my_objective    # callable(tic, tvc, mp) -> float
designer.process_constraints = my_constraints  # callable(tic, tvc, mp) -> list
designer.dw_sense            = "maximize"
designer.dw_bounds_tic       = [(lb, ub), ...]

designer.find_optimal_operating_point(
    init_guess     = np.array([[60.0, 70.0, 1.0]]),
    solver         = "ipopt",
    solver_options = {"linear_solver": "ma57"},
)

# Stage 2
designer.dw_spt = np.array([t_final])
designer.design_experiment(
    criterion               = designer.v_opt_criterion,
    solver                  = "ipopt",
    solver_options          = {"linear_solver": "ma57"},
    optimize_sampling_times = True,
)
```

See `examples/v_optimal_test_case.py` for a complete worked example with
a batch reactor system featuring three competing reactions.
